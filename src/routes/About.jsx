        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Hello! I'm Scott — the maker, designer, and owner behind TheScottish3D.
          My passion for 3D printing began in a small workshop in the Highlands,
          where creativity meets cutting‑edge technology. Today, I combine years of
          design experience with state‑of‑the‑art printers to bring unique, durable
          creations to life.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Each item is printed using biodegradable PLA or PETG sourced from local
          suppliers. Sustainability, craftsmanship, and customer satisfaction are
          at the heart of every product.
        </p>

          Thank you for supporting a small business. Slàinte mhath!
